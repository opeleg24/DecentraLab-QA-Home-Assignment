  "What is ETH staking?": "ETH staking is a process in which ETH holders can use their ETH to power the Ethereum blockchain and earn rewards in the process.",
  "What tokens can be staked?": "Boosted APR in form of unlocked $HORD is given to stakers on Hord, with extra allocation for stETH and wstETH stakers.",
  "What is hETH?": "hETH is a token that represents the entire holdings in Hord’s ETH Staking pool. As validator rewards are added to the pool, the price of hETH is expected to increase in relation to ETH.",
  "Why is hETH price higher than Lido?": "hETH's launch price was 2.53 ETH. This was due to the early accumulation of validator rewards before the pool was open to the public. While the price of hETH will continue to be higher than the price of ETH, this also means its value is higher, as the withdrawal power of 1 hETH is expected to grow over time as more rewards are earned by our validators.",
  "What are HORD rewards?": "Extra rewards are given to early adaptors in the form of tradable, unlocked HORD tokens. HORD will be used as Hord’s protocol token with in-app utility in the upcoming months. Details to be announced.",
  "How can hETH be redeemed for ETH?": "There are 2 options to get ETH back. Users can directly withdraw from the app by requesting a withdrawal, and then claiming their ETH. This can take up to 4 days depending on the withdrawal queue but is usually quicker. Alternatively, users can directly swap their hETH for ETH on Uniswap at any time.",
  "What is the reward fee?": "As a protocol, Hord takes a 10% fee of accumulated rewards, which goes towards operating the validators needed to stake ETH. To collect fees, Hord periodically mints proportional hETH representing its share.",
  "What is Hord?": "Hord is a Liquid ETH Staking protocol that maximizes staking rewards through auto-compounding, MEV boost and extra HORD rewards. Hord is built by DcentraLab, an experienced web3 company with over $500M TVL"
